# Managing User Privileges

## Executing commands as root

```bash
sudo [command]
```

> Note: user has to be part of wheel/sudoers group

## Logging in as root

```bash
sudo --login
```

```bash
su -
```

## Disable logins as root

```bash
sudo passwd --lock root
sudo passwd -l root
```

> Note: Locking the root password will disable this, but not the usage of sudo.

## Add user to root group

```bash
usermod -aG wheel user # for rhel
usermod -aG sudo user # for debian 
```

## The sudoers file

To manage who can run what commands with elevated privileges, edit the `/etc/sudoers` file.

Do not edit this file manually, use the `visudo` command.

**The file format**:

```bash
USER    HOST=(RUN_AS)   COMMANDS
%GROUP  HOST=(RUN_AS)   COMMANDS
```

**Examples**:

- Allow all users in `administrators` group to run any command as sudo with no password

```bash
%administrators   ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL
```

- Allow john to run only `ls` as sudo
```bash
john    ALL=(ALL)   /bin/ls
```

- Allow john to run only `ls` as sudo with no password
```bash
john    ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: /bin/ls
```

- Allow john to run commands as mike or annie
```bash
johnn   ALL=(mike,annie)  ALL
```
